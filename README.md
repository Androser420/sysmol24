### modules
you can now spice up your theme/flavor with add-ons inside the `/theme/modules` folder!  
if you've picked one you like, simply insert it to the top of the code as usual.  
- e.g. `@import url('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Androser420/sysmol24/refs/heads/main/theme/modules/extra-collapsible.css');`
